Welcome to `HackYourFuture` community! In order to be accepted into the program, you are required
to complete this assignment, which involves creating a simple `calculator` using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This README will guide you through the setup process and provide detailed instructions for completing
the assignment.

## Assignment Details

Your task is to create a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure is already
provided in the starter files. You will need to write the CSS to style the calculator and the JavaScript
to make it functional.

## Set up

Before you start working on the assignment, you need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps
to get started:

1. **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, please install it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

   operating system. You can download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

3. **Visual Studio Code:** Install Visual Studio Code, a text editor that will help you write your code.
   You can download it from [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

4. **Live Server Extension:** Install the Live Server extension for Visual Studio Code. Once installed,
   right-click on your `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server" to preview your calculator in
   your browser. Please use Google Chrome for the best experience

5. **GitHub Account:** If you don't already have a GitHub account, go to [www.github.com](https://www.github.com)
   and create one. Please use your real name as your GitHub username, all in lowercase with no spaces (e.g., `samirm00`).
